   * define COLOR_STACK to enable this feature.
   *
   * You can mark RAM with a known value say 0xfeee. Then at runtime
   * use mspdebug to examine memory looking for locations that no
   * longer have the value of 0xfeee. Memory in ram that no longer
   * contains the value 0xfeee is an indication that it has been used
   * by a data variable, the heap or as stack memory.
   *
   * You need to write a function that runs prior to the start of
   * main and "colors" ram. Link this function with your code and
   * run it with mspdebug. Use CTRL-C to break after you have
   * exercised all your functions. Then use the eXamine gdb cmd:
   *
   * > x/4xw 0x200
   *
   * Here we are eXamining ram memory starting at the lowest address
   * (0x200 is the first ram location for most g series chips).
   * Each time you press enter after that command, it will show
   * the value of the next 4 words of ram. Press enter repeatedly
   * and skip over the bss and data addresses and then start looking
   * for '0xfeee', that is where the heap ends. Continue looking for
   * 0xfeee until it changes, that address indicates the lowest stack
   * value. The difference between the end of the heap and the lowest
   * stack address is how much free ram you have.
   *
   * Note: If the value 0xfeee is a common value used in your program
   * then you probably want to use another value to color the stack.
   *
   * Note: You can't get the amount of free ram just looking at the
   * static numbers provided by the compiler. You must run your code
   * and exercise all code paths to find out the true amount of memory
   * your application uses.
